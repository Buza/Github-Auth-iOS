Github-Auth-iOS
=========

This is a simple UIViewController that performs the Github authentication steps on iOS.

Summary
-----------

Github-Auth-iOS might be useful for you if you're building an iOS app that requires Github authentication to access the API. This example presents a UIViewController for the user to use for login, and does the authentication dance with Github to retrieve an access token that may be used for further API requests (creating Gists, reading user data, etc.)

Note that in order to use this, you will need to obtain a [client ID and secret for your app from Github](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)
